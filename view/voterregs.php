        <h2>Why do I need to register?</h2>
        <p>
            The entire point of registering to vote is to actually be able to vote in elections.
            But the actual reason why voter registration is a thing in South Africa is to make sure that only eligible South African citizens cast their vote and no one else.
        </p>

        <h2>What do I need to be able to register to vote?</h2>
        <p>
            To <a href="https://registertovote.elections.org.za/voter-online-registration/overview" target="_blank">register</a> you'll need:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To be 16 years and older (although you can only vote at 18 and older)</li>
            <li>To be a South African citizen</li>
            <li>A valid ID Smartcard (the newer post-2013 IDs cards) or a green ID booklet (the older pre-2013 ID booklets)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>And on voting day? What do I need to do/have then?</h2>
        <p>
            On voting day, <a href="https://www.elections.org.za/pw/Voter/Voter-Information" target="_blank">check that you're correctly registered</a> (preferrably before it's voting day lol) 
            and <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.elections.org.za/vsfinder/">check your voting station</a>. 
            Head to your voting station with your ID. And most importantly, VOTE!
        </p>

        <h2>Okay cool, but how do I ACTUALLY vote?</h2>
        <p>
            Well, in the coming 2024 elections, you'd be able to vote for independent candidates (individual candidates in other words)
            , which wasn't possible before in previous elections (let's rather not discuss how the ANC botched the electoral reforms). 
            You'll get three ballot papers (the papers you vote on) after being processed in the voting station on arrival.
        </p>

        <p>
            These ballot papers are:
            <ul>
                <li>National (You'll vote for a party on this ballot to be represented in the National Assembly, better known as Parliament)</li>
                <li>Provincial (You'll vote for a party/independent candidate on this ballot to be represented in your province's legislature)</li>
                <li>Regional (You'll vote for a party/independent candidate on this ballot to be represented in the National Assembly, better known as Parliament)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            On each ballot, only mark a visible, clearly readable "X" (without the quotes) in the box given next to your party/candidate of choice (only one though), otherwise your vote is spoiled and it won't count.
